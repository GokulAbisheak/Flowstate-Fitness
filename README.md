#### Brief Description of Project

Flowstate Fitness Center is a child company of Softacare. Softacare is a leading and reputable 
company in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, specialized in the Health and Medical Industry. Softacare’s 
history dates back to 2005. After their 18 years of experience in Health and Medical they have 
decided to step into a branch of Health, which is physical health.

Flowstate Fitness aims to increase physical well-being of their clients by providing various 
facilities and services to their clients. Flowstate Fitness does not limit themselves to just being a 
physical gymnasium, but they also provide virtual training and education about physical fitness.
They are planning to computerize almost all the business processes available, and they prefer a
modern looking, responsive and reliable system which can be accessed from anywhere and any 
devices to both administrators and clients.

According to the requirement by the client, we are planning to build a web application using 
MERN stack. We also planned to use MongoDB cloud storage. MaterialUI to achieve modern 
looking and responsive web application.

#### Technologies used - MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), MaterialUI
